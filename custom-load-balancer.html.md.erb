This topic describes how to use your own load balancer and forward traffic to your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) router IP address.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> includes a tier of reverse proxies that dynamically track the location of app containers and system components, enabling routing of requests to those endpoints even as IPs and ports change.

In order for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers to be horizontally scalable and highly available, a load balancer must be deployed in front of them. The simplest solution is to use a Layer 4 TCP load balancer, provided by your IaaS or IT team, which passes all HTTP and TLS handling to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers. For more information about TLS termination, see [Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html). For a description of features supported by the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routing tier, see [HTTP Routing](../concepts/http-routing.html).

If you have requirements that are not fulfilled by the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers alone, you can choose to use your own Layer 7 load balancer provided by your IaaS or IT team, or the HAProxy load balancer included with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. If you use HAProxy, you must use a Layer 4 TCP load balancer in front of it in order for HAProxy itself to be highly available. Singleton instances of HAProxy are only for use in lab and test environments.

If you use your own Layer 7 load balancer, it must fulfill the following requirements:

* Provides load balancing to each of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> router IP addresses

* Supports TLS termination for wildcard hostnames

* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers to incoming requests

* Sets an HTTP keepalive connection timeout greater than five seconds

* (Optional) Supports WebSocket

The choice to use HAProxy or your own load balancer depends on what features you need out of a load balancer, and whether you want the ability to configure it yourself.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> App logging with Loggregator requires WebSocket. To use another logging service, see <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html">Streaming App Logs to Log Management Services</a>.</p>

For information about how to install an F5 Local Traffic Manager (LTM) as a load balancer for <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, see [Configuring an F5 Load Balancer for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](f5-lb.html). For more information about F5 LTMs, see the [F5](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) documentation.


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To integrate your own load balancer with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you must ensure:

* WebSocket connections are not blocked for Loggregator functionality.
* The load balancer must be able to reach the Gorouter IP addresses.

Follow the procedure below to use your own load balancer.


## <a id='deploy'></a> Step 1: Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation VM

Deploy an <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation VM. For more information, see [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/deploy.html).


## <a id='register'></a> Step 2: Register <%= vars.ops_manager %> IP Address

In your load balancer, register the IP addresses that you assigned to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.


## <a id='configure'></a> Step 3: Configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> and BOSH Director

Configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> and the BOSH Director as described in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/config.html), then add <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

Do not click **Install** after adding <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.


## <a id='configure-networking'></a> Step 4: Configure Networking

Configure the **Networking** pane in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Load balancer configuration in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> varies depending on which IaaS you are using for <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Configure Networking](configure-pas.html#networking) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.


## <a id='finalize'></a> Step 5: Finalize Changes

To finalize the changes to your deployment:

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Install**.
