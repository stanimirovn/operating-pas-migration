If your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) deployment uses the internal user store for authentication, you can configure its password policy within the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.


## <a id="config-access"></a> Open the Internal UAA Configuration

To open the internal UAA configuration for your deployment:

1. In a browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ops Manager and log in.

1. Click the **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>** tile.

1. Select **Authentication and Enterprise SSO**.

	<%= image_tag("er-config-auth-enterprise-sso-uaa.png", alt: "The page header says 'Authentication and Enterprise SSO'. Below this header is the text 'For help configuring these fields, see the Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO section of the Configuring PAS topic in the PCF documentation,' with 'Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO' in blue letters to denote a clickable link. Below this text is the text 'Configure your UAA user account store with either internal or external authentication mechanisms:', with a red asterisk to denote that it is a required field. Below this text is a selected radio button labeled 'Internal UAA'. Below this radio button are fields labeled, from top to bottom: 'Minimum password length', 'Minimum uppercase characters', 'Minimum lowercase characters', 'Minimum numerical digits', 'Minimum special characters', and 'Maximum password entry attempts allowed'. All of these fields are marked with red asterisks. All fields contain the text '0' except for 'Maximum password entry attempts allowed', which contains the text '5'. Below these fields are two more radio buttons labeled 'SAML identity provider' and 'LDAP server'. At the bottom of the image is a blue rectangular button labeled 'Save'.") %>

1. Confirm that the **Internal UAA** option is selected.
