The API endpoint for your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> deployment, its target URL, is the API endpoint of the deployment's Cloud Controller. Find your Cloud Controller API endpoint by consulting your cloud operator, from the Apps Manager, or from the command line.


## <a id='console'></a> From the Apps Manager

Log in to the Apps Manager for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance, then click **Tools** in the left navigation panel. The **Getting Started** section of the Tools page shows your API endpoint.

<%= image_tag("getting-started-api.png", :alt => "'Getting Started' section shows example output from a command line, including the API endpoint." ) %>


## <a id='cli'></a> From the Command Line

From a command line, use the `cf api` command to view your API endpoint.

Example:

<pre class='termnial'>
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.example.com (API version: 2.2.0)
</pre>
