This topic describes the types of logs that <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) generates. It also explains how to forward system logs to an external aggregator service, how to scale Loggregator component VMs to keep up with app log volume, and how to manage app traffic logging. For more information about Loggregator components, see [Loggregator Architecture](../loggregator/architecture.html).


## <a id='types'></a> System Logs, App Logs, App Traffic Logs

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> generates two types of logs, _system logs_ from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components and _app logs_ from hosted apps, as differentiated in the table below:

<table id='log-types' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>Log Type</th>
    <th>Originate from</th>
    <th>Follow format</th>
    <th>Stream from</th>
    <th>Can stream out to (configurable)</th>
    <th>Visible to</th>
  </tr><tr>
  	<th>System Logs</th>
    <td>Platform components</td>
    <td>Syslog standard</td>
    <td>rsyslog agent</td>
    <td>Component syslog drain</td>
    <td>Operators</td>
  </tr><tr>
  	<th rowspan=3>App Logs</th>
    <td rowspan=3>Hosted apps</td>
    <td>Format is up to the developer</td>
    <td>Firehose<sup>1</sup></td>
    <td>External data platform, optionally via nozzles</td>
    <td rowspan=3>Developers and Operators</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FBFBFB">Converted to syslog standard</td>
    <td bgcolor="#FBFBFB">Syslog Agent</td>
    <td bgcolor="#FBFBFB">External syslog drain</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>1</sup>The Loggregator Firehose also streams component metrics.

**App traffic logs are system logs.** When app containers communicate, or attempt to communicate, their host Diego Cells generate _app traffic logs_. App traffic logs are system logs, not app logs. These logs come from host Diego Cells, not apps, and they carry no information from within the app. App traffic logs only show app communication behavior, as detected from outside by the host Diego Cell.


## <a id="log-cache"></a> Log Cache

Log Cache is a Loggregator feature that lets you filter and query app logs through a CLI plugin or API endpoints. Cached app logs are available on demand; you do not need to stream them continuously.

### <a id="log-cache-cli-examples"></a> Example Uses of the Log Cache CLI Plugin

To access cached logs with the Log Cache CLI plugin, you must first download and install the plugin.

To download the Log Cache CLI plugin, see the [cf CLI Plugins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#log-cache) page on the Cloud Foundry website.

After you have installed the plugin, the basic command to access cached app logs is:

```
cf tail OPTIONS APP-NAME-OR-ID
```

Where:

* `OPTIONS` are the flags you use to filter app logs.
* `APP-NAME-OR-ID` is the name or source ID of your app.

Some flags you can use Log Cache to filter app logs are:

* `--start-time`: Displays the start of the cache or the start of a time period you specify. Results display as a UNIX timestamp, in nanoseconds. Pair with `--end-time` to view logs within a time period.

* `--end-time`: Displays the end of the cache or the end of a time period you specify. Results display as a UNIX timestamp, in nanoseconds. Pair with `--start-time` to view logs within a time period.

* `--json`: Output logs in JSON.

* `--follow`: Append exported logs to `stdout`.

For more information on using the Log Cache CLI, see [Log Cache CLI: Usage](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-cli/blob/develop/README.md) on GitHub.

### <a id="log-cache-api-examples"></a> Example Uses of the Log Cache API

The Log Cache API is hosted on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, and references your system domain to return responses. The root URL for API calls is `https://log-cache.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your system domain.

The basic call to access and filter cached app logs is:

```
GET https://log-cache.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/read/APP-ID
```

Where:

* `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your system domain.
* `APP-ID` is the source ID of your app.

Append the following parameters to your `GET` call to customize app logs:

* `start_time`: Displays the start of the cache or the start of a time period you specify. Results display as a UNIX timestamp, in nanoseconds. Pair with `end_time` to view logs within a time period.

* `end_time`: Displays the end of the cache or the end of a time period you specify. Results display as a UNIX timestamp, in nanoseconds. Pair with `start_time` to view logs within a time period.

* `envelope_types`: Filters by Envelope Type. The available filters are: `LOG`, `COUNTER`, `GAUGE`, `TIMER`, and `EVENT`. Set an envelope type filter to emit logs of only that type. Specify this parameter multiple times to include more types.

* `limit`: Sets a maximum number of envelopes to request. The max limit is 1000. This value defaults to 100.

More API parameters are available to customize retrieved app logs. For more information, see [Log Cache: RESTful API Gateway](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache#restful-api-via-gateway).

<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/system_logging" %>


## <a id='container-metrics'></a> Include Container Metrics in Syslog Drains

Developers can monitor container metrics over the syslog protocol using the [CF Drain CLI plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-drain-cli). With the CF Drain CLI plugin, you can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool to set the app container to deliver container metrics to a syslog drain. Developers can then monitor the app container based on those metrics.

For more information, see [Including Container Metrics in Syslog Drains](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#container-metrics) in _App Logging in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.


## <a id='scaling'></a> Scale Loggregator

Apps constantly generate app logs and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> platform components constantly generate component metrics. The Loggregator system combines these data streams and handles them as follows. For more information, see [Loggregator Architecture](../loggregator/architecture.html).

* The Loggregator agent running on each component or app VM collects and sends this data out to Doppler components.

* Doppler components temporarily buffer the data before periodically forwarding it to the Traffic Controller. When the log and metrics data input to a Doppler exceeds its buffer size for a given interval, data can be lost.

* The Traffic Controller serves the aggregated data stream through the Firehose WebSocket endpoint.

Follow the instructions below to scale the Loggregator system. For guidance on monitoring and capacity planning, see [Monitoring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/customizing/monitoring/).

### <a id="instances"></a> Add Component VM Instances

To add component VM instances for Loggregator components:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Increase the number in the **Instances** column of the component you want to scale. You can add instances for the following Loggregator components:
	* **Loggregator Traffic Controller**
		<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) BOSH job is colocated on the Traffic Controller VM. If you want to scale Loggregator to handle more logs for syslog drains, you can add instances of the Traffic Controller. For more information, see <a href="../loggregator/architecture.html">Loggregator Architecture</a>.</p>
		<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The BOSH System Metrics Forwarder</a> job is colocated on the Traffic Controller VM. If you want to scale Loggregator to handle more BOSH component metrics, you can add instances of the Traffic Controller. For more information, see <a href="../loggregator/architecture.html#bosh-metrics">Related BOSH Components</a> in <em>Loggregator Architecture</em>.</p>
	* **Doppler Server**

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.


## <a id="app-traffic-log"></a> App Traffic Logging

App traffic logging generates logs when app containers communicate with each other directly, or attempt to communicate, as allowed by container-to-container networking (C2C) policies and App Security Groups (ASGs). For more information about C2C policies, see [Container-to-Container Networking versus ASGs](../concepts/understand-cf-networking.html#c2cvsasg) in _Container-to-Container Networking_. For more information about ASGs, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html).

App traffic logging lets network security teams audit C2C traffic, by seeing allowed and denied packets, without needing access to the Cloud Controller or the apps themselves.

### <a id="enable-app-traffic-log"></a> Enable App Traffic Logging

To enable app traffic logging:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select the **Networking** pane.

1. Enable the **Log traffic for all accepted and denied app packets** checkbox.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id="log-behavior"></a> App Logging Behavior

App traffic logging generates log messages as follows:

* **TCP traffic:** Logs the first packet of every new TCP connection.

* **UDP traffic:** Logs UDP packets sent and received, up to a maximum per-second rate for each container. Set this rate limit in the **UDP logging interval** field in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. The default rate limit is `100`.

* **Packets denied:** Logs packets blocked by either a container-specific networking policy or by ASG rules applied across the space, org, or deployment. Logs packet denials up to a maximum per-second rate for each container, set in the **Denied logging interval** field in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. The default rate is `1`. For more information about container-specific networking policies, see [Policies](../concepts/understand-cf-networking.html#policies) in _Container-to-Container Networking_.

### <a id="log-format"></a> App Traffic Log Format and Contents

App traffic logs are formatted as described in the [silk-release Traffic logging](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk-release/blob/develop/docs/traffic_logging.md) documentation, following the `iptables-logger` format but without line breaks.

For example, the first part of an app traffic log line looks like: `{"timestamp": "2020-06-23T11:36:01.710452019Z", "source": "cfnetworking.iptables", "message": "cfnetworking.iptables.ingress-allowed", "log_level": 1, "data": { "destination": { "container_id": "d5978989-1401-49ff-46cd-33e5","app_guid": "bc6f229d-5e4a-4c41-a63f-e8795496c283",`.

Each log message includes:

* A timestamp, either in RFC3339 format or in epoch format. The format depends upon the configuration of the **Timestamp format for component logs** in the **System Logging** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile 

* The GUID for the source or destination app that sent or was designated to receive the packet

* The protocol of the communication, `TCP` or `UDP`

* GUIDs for the container, space, and org running the source or destination app

* IP addresses and ports for both source and destination apps

* A `message` field recording whether the packet was allowed or denied, with one of the following four possibilities:
  * `ASG allowed packet to exit source app container`
  * `C2C policy allowed packet to enter destination app container`
  * `ASG prevented packet from exiting source app container`
  * `C2C policy prevented packet from entering destination app container`

* Additional information described in the [silk-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk-release/blob/develop/docs/traffic_logging.md) documentation

#### <a id="denied-packet"></a> Denied Packet Causes

You can determine whether a denied-packet log resulted from a container networking policy or an ASG rule as follows:

* **Container networking policy:** Log `message` string includes `ingress-denied` and `packet direction` is `ingress`.

* **ASG rule:** Log `message` string includes `egress-denied` and `packet direction` is `egress`.

### <a id="scope-app-traffic-log"></a> Global vs. ASG-Level App Traffic Logging

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> supports two mechanisms for enabling app traffic logging. Enabling the **Log traffic for all accepted and denied app packets** checkbox in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile enables app traffic logging globally for all ASGs and container policies. Setting the `log` property of an ASG to `true` enables app traffic logging at the individual ASG level. For more information about setting the `log` property of an ASG to `true`, see [The Structure and Attributes of ASGs](../concepts/asg.html#creating-groups) in _App Security Groups_.

Because these two mechanisms operate independently, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> generates duplicate logs when app traffic logging is enabled globally and an ASG's `log` property is set to `true`. To avoid duplicate logs, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends setting the `log` property to `false` for all ASGs, or leaving it out entirely, when app traffic logging is enabled globally. For more information, see [App Traffic Logging](#app-traffic-log).

To focus on specific ASGs for log analysis, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends enabling app traffic logs globally and using a logging platform to filter traffic logs by ASG, rather than setting `log` at the individual ASG level.
