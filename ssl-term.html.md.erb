title: Configuring SSL Termination for Ops Manager on vSphere
owner: Ops Manager
---

To use SSL termination in <%= vars.platform_name %>, you must configure the HAProxy load balancer or your own load balancer.

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use HAProxy in lab and test environments only. Production environments should instead use a highly-available customer-provided load balancing solution.

Choose an SSL termination method to determine the steps you must take to configure <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).


## <a id="haproxy"></a> Use the HAProxy Load Balancer

<%= vars.platform_name %> deploys with a single instance of HAProxy for use in lab and test environments. You can use this HAProxy instance for SSL termination and load balancing to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouters. HAProxy can generate a self-signed certificate if you do not want to obtain a signed certificate from a well-known certificate authority (CA).

<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/known-issue-self-signed-certs" %>

To use the HAProxy load balancer:

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to the HAProxy IP address. The A record associates the **System domain** and **Apps domain** that you configure in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile with the HAProxy IP address.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, with `<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>.example.com` as the main subdomain for your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation and an HAProxy IP address `203.0.113.1`, you must create an A record in your DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.platform_name_lc` to `203.0.113.1`.

    <table >
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Data</th>
			<th>Domain</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>*.<%= vars.platform_name_lc %></td>
		    <td>A</td>
		    <td>203.0.113.1</td>
		    <td>example.com</td>
        </tr>
	</table>

1. Test your DNS entry by running:

	```
	host
	```
	This command should return your HAProxy IP address.

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. Leave the **Gorouter IPs** field blank. HAProxy assigns the Gorouter IPs internally.

1. Enter the IP address for HAProxy in the **HAProxy IPs** field.

1. Provide your SSL certificate in the **Certificates and private keys for the Gorouter and HAProxy** fields. For more information, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](./security_config.html).


## <a id="other"></a> Use Another Load Balancer

Production environments should use a highly-available customer-provided load balancing solution that:

* Provides SSL termination with wildcard DNS location
* Provides load balancing to each of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouter IPs
* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers

To use your own load balancer:

1. Register one or more static IP address for <%= vars.platform_name %> with your load balancer.

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to your load balancer IP address. The A record associates the **System domain** and **Apps domain** that you configure in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile with the IP address of your load balancer.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, with `<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>.example.com` as the main subdomain for your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation and a load balancer IP address `198.51.100.1`, you must create an A record in your DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>` to `198.51.100.1`.

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
    	<tr>
	        <th>Name</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Data</th>
			<th>Domain</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>*.<%= vars.platform_name_lc %></td>
		    <td>A</td>
		    <td>198.51.100.1</td>
		    <td>example.com</td>
      	</tr>
    </table>

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. In the **Gorouter IPs** field, enter the static IP address for <%= vars.platform_name %> that you have registered with your load balancer.

1. Leave the **HAProxy IPs** field blank.

1. Provide your SSL certificate in the **Certificates and private keys for the Gorouter and HAProxy** fields. For more information, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](./security_config.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When adding or removing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouters, you must update your load balancing solution configuration with the appropriate IP addresses.</p>
