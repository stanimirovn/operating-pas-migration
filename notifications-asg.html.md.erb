This topic describes configuring App Security Groups (ASGs) to give network access to the Notifications Service.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

To allow the Notifications Service to have network access, you must create ASGs. Without ASGS, you cannot use the Notifications Service.

For more information, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html).


## <a id='notifications-service'></a> Prerequisite

Before configuring ASGs for the Notifications Service, you must first set up the Notifications Service. To set up the Notifications Service, see [Getting Started with the Notifications Service](../adminguide/notifications.html).


## <a id="notifications-service-network-connections"></a> Configure Network Connections

The Notifications Service is deployed as a suite of apps to the `notifications-with-ui` space in the `system` org. It requires the following outbound network connections:

| Destination | Ports | Protocol | Reason |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| `SMTP_SERVER` | 587 (default) | tcp (default) | This service is used to send out email notifications. |
| `LOAD_BALANCER_IP` | 80, 443 | tcp | This service accesses the load balancer. |
| `ASSIGNED_NETWORK` | 3306 | tcp | This service requires access to internal services. `ASSIGNED_NETWORK` is the CIDR of the network assigned to this service. |

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The SMTP server port and protocol are dependent on how you configure your server.</p>

### <a id="smtp"></a> Create a SMTP Server ASG

To create an ASG for your SMTP server:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) tile.

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

1. Record the values in the **SMTP server address** and **SMTP server port** fields.

1. Using the **SMTP server address** you obtained in the previous step, find the IP addresses and protocol of your SMTP server from the service you are using. You might need to contact your service provider for this information.

1. Create a `smtp-server.json` file. For `destination`, you must enter the IP address of your SMTP Server.

    ```
    [
        {
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "destination": SMTP_SERVER_IPS,
            "ports": "587"
        }
    ]
    ```

1. Create an ASG called `smtp-server` by running:

    ```
    cf create-security-group smtp-server smtp-server.json
    ```

### <a id="load-balancer"></a> Create a Load Balancer ASG

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have an ASG set up for a load balancer, you do not need to do this step. To check which groups you have set up, see <a href="../concepts/asg.html">App Security Groups</a>.</p>

If you are using the internal HAProxy as your load balancer, follow this procedure. If you are using an external load balancer, you must obtain your HAProxy IPs from the service you are using.

To create an ASG for a load balancer:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. Record the values in the **HAProxy IPs** field.

1. Create a `load-balancer-https.json` file. For `destination`, use the **HAProxy IPs** you recorded above.

    ```
    [
        {
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "destination": "10.68.196.250",
            "ports": "80,443"
        }
    ]
    ```

1. Create an ASG called `load-balancer-https` by running:

    ```
    cf create-security-group load-balancer-https load-balancer-https.json
    ```

### <a id="assigned-network"></a> Create an Assigned Network ASG

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you use external services, the IP addresses, ports, and protocols depend on the service.</p>

To create an ASG for an assigned network:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Record the network selected in the **Network** dropdown.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the BOSH Director tile.

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Record the **CIDR** for the network you identified in **Assign AZs and Networks**. Ensure the subnet mask allows the space to access `p-mysql`, `p-rabbitmq`, and `p-redis`.

1. Create a file `assigned-network.json`. For the `destination`, enter the **CIDR** you recorded above.

    ```
    [
        {
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "destination": "10.68.0.0/20",
            "ports": "3306,5672,6379"
        }
    ]
    ```

1. Create an ASG called `assigned-network` by running:

    ```
    cf create-security-group assigned-network assigned-network.json
    ```


## <a id="pre-installation-asg-binding"></a> Bind the ASGs

After creating your ASGs, you must bind them to the Notifications Service.

To bind your ASGs to the Notifications Service:

1. Target the `system` org by running:

    ```
    cf target -o system
    ```

1. Create a `notifications-with-ui` space by running:

    ```
    cf create-space notifications-with-ui
    ```

1. Bind the ASGs you created in this topic to the `notifications-with-ui` space by running:

    ```
    cf bind-security-group smtp-server system notifications-with-ui
    cf bind-security-group load-balancer-https system notifications-with-ui
    cf bind-security-group assigned-network system notifications-with-ui
    ```
