title: Creating a Proxy ELB for Diego SSH

If you want to allow SSH connections to application containers, you may want to use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) as the SSH proxy.

Perform the steps below to create this ELB:

1. On the EC2 Dashboard, click **Load Balancers**.

1. Click **Create Load Balancer** and configure a classic load balancer with the following information:

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_elb_step1.png", :alt => "AWS screenshot of 'Define Load Balancer' page with Basic Configuration and Select Subnets.") %>
  * Enter a load balancer name.
  * **Create LB Inside**: Select the **<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>-vpc** VPC where your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation lives.
  * Ensure that the **Create an internal load balancer** checkbox is not selected.
1. Under **Load Balancer Protocol**, ensure that this ELB is listening on TCP port `2222` and forwarding to TCP port `2222`.

1. Under **Select Subnets**, select the public subnet.
1. On the **Assign Security Groups** page, create a new Security Group. This Security Group should allow inbound traffic on TCP port `2222`.

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_elb_securitygroup.png", :alt => "'Create Security Group' window has an inbound Custom TCP rule with 2222 port range.") %>

1. The **Configure Security Settings** page displays a security warning because your load balancer is not using a secure listener. You can ignore this warning.

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_elb_security_warning.png", :alt => "Yellow warning is below 'Configure Security Settings' header. The warning is titled Improve your load balancer's security. Your load balancer is not using any secure listener.") %>

1. Click **Next: Configure Health Check**.

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_elb_healthcheck.png", :alt => "'Configure Health Check' page has two Ping fields and several more under the 'Advanced Details' section.") %>

1. Select **TCP in Ping Protocol** on the **Configure Health Check** page. Ensure that the **Ping Port** value is `2222` and set the **Health Check Interval** to `30` seconds.

1. Click **Next: Add EC2 Instances**.

1. Accept the defaults on the **Add EC2 Instances** page and click **Next: Add Tags**.

1. Accept the defaults on the **Add Tags** page and click **Review and Create**.

1. Review and confirm the load balancer details and click **Create**.

1. With your DNS service (for example, Amazon Route 53), create an <code>ssh.system.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code> DNS record that points to this ELB that you just created.

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_elb_domain.png", :alt => "'Create Record Set' form has a TTL of 300 and a value of 'your-elb-domain'.") %>

1. You can now use this ELB to the SSH Proxy of your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) installation.

2. In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, select **Resource Config** and enter the ELB that you just created in the **Diego Brain** row, under the Load Balancers column.

	<%= image_tag("aws/aws_ssh_er_diego_brain_config.png", :alt => "Screenshot of a section of the Resource Config, where Diego Brain is between UAA and Diego Cell.") %>
