This topic describes how to configure SSL/TLS termination at HAProxy in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Both <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> include an HAProxy instance.

HAProxy is appropriate to use in a deployment when features are needed that are offered by HAProxy but are not offered by the Gorouters or IaaS-provided load balancers, such as with Azure load balancers. These include filtering of protected domains from trusted networks.

While HAProxy instances provide load balancing for the Gorouters, HAProxy is not itself highly available. For production environments, use a highly-available load balancer to scale HAProxy horizontally. The load balancer does not need to terminate TLS or even operate at Layer 7 (HTTP), as it can provide Layer 4 load balancing of TCP connections. Use of HAProxy does not remove the need for Gorouters. The Gorouter must always be deployed for HTTP apps, and the TCP router for non-HTTP apps.

You can generate a self-signed certificate for HAProxy if you do not want to obtain a signed certificate from a certificate authority (CA).

You only need to perform this procedure if you are using one instance of HAProxy such as in a development environment. If you would like HAProxy to be highly available, you must have a load balancer in front of it. In this case, you point DNS at the load balancer.

To use a single-instance HAProxy load balancer in a vSphere or OpenStack deployment:

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to the HAProxy IP address. The A record associates the **System domain** and **Apps domain** that you configure in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.platform_name %> tile with the HAProxy IP address.
    <br>
    <br>
    For example, with `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>.example.com` as the main subdomain for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment and an HAProxy IP address `203.0.113.1`, you must create an A record in your DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.<%= vars.product_name_lc %>` to `203.0.113.1`.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Data</th>
        <th>Domain</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>*.<%= vars.product_name_lc %></td>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>203.0.113.1</td>
        <td>example.com</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. To test your DNS entry, run:

    ```
    host
    ```
    The `host` command should return your HAProxy IP address.
