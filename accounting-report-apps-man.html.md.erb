This topic describes how to retrieve app, task, and service instance usage information using Apps Manager.

You can also retrieve app, task, and service instance usage information using the Usage service API, or the Cloud Foundry API from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see [Monitoring App, Task, and Service Instance Usage](../opsguide/accounting-report.html).

There are two ways to monitor app, task, and service instance usage from Apps Manager. The Accounting Report provides a summarized report, and the Usage Report provides a more detailed view of the data.


## <a id="accounting-report"></a> View the Accounting Report

The Accounting Report displays instance usage information for all orgs in your [<%= vars.platform_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) deployment except the **system** org. The Accounting Report provides a high-level overview of your usage by displaying your monthly count of app, task, and service instances.

To access the Accounting Report:

1. Log in to the Apps Manager as an admin. For more information, see [Logging In to Apps Manager](../customizing/console-login.html)

1. Select **Accounting Report**.

1. Under **App Statistics** and **Service Usage**, view the average and maximum instances in use per month.
	<br><br>
	**Max Concurrent** displays the largest number of instances in use at a time over the indicated time period. The Accounting Report calculates these values from the `start`, `stop`, and `scale` app usage events in Cloud Controller.

The Usage Report provides a more granular view of your usage by detailing app, task, and service instance usage information for all spaces in a particular org, excluding the **system** org.

To access the Usage Report:

1. Log in to the Apps Manager as an admin, or as an account with the **Org Manager** or **Org Auditor** role. For more information about managing roles, see [Managing User Accounts and Permissions Using the Apps Manager](../console/console-roles.html).

1. From the dropdown on the left, select the org for which you want to view a usage report.

1. Click **Usage Report** in the upper right.

    The top of the Usage Report displays total **App + Task Instance Hours**, **App + Task Memory**, and **Service Instance Hours** by all spaces in the org.
